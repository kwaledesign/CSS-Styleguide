  <h1 id="css-guidelines">CSS Guidelines</h1>
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline a collection of opinionated best-practices and methodologies for building object-oriented CSS architectures that are both highly scalable and easily maintained. Encapsulation is the key to achieving these objectives of modularity which is why all entities within a design system are defined as components, even ones that are non-visual.</p>
<h1 id="general-principles">General Principles</h1>
<h2 id="whitespace-and-comments">Whitespace and Comments</h2>
<p>The key to portable code is in carefully documenting each component's purpose, how it works, and if necessary its intended markup pattern. Comment sections and subsections are optional, but often not needed when code is segregated into dedication Sass partials. In that case, it is perfectly acceptable to exclusively use the major and minor comment blocks. Major comment blocks should always have a trailing empty line and minor comment blocks should not.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="co">/* ==========================================================================</span>
<span class="co">   Section comment block</span>
<span class="co">   ==========================================================================</span>
<span class="co">*/</span>

<span class="co">/* Sub-section comment block</span>
<span class="co">   ========================================================================== */</span>


<span class="co">/**</span>
<span class="co">* Major Comment Block</span>
<span class="co">*</span>
<span class="co">* The first sentence of the long description starts here and continues on this</span>
<span class="co">* line for a while finally concluding here at the end of this paragraph.</span>
<span class="co">*</span>
<span class="co">* The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and</span>
<span class="co">* documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other information</span>
<span class="co">* that is deemed necessary or useful.</span>
<span class="co">*</span>
<span class="co">*/</span>


<span class="co">/**</span>
<span class="co"> * Minor Comment Block</span>
<span class="co"> */</span>


<span class="co">/* Basic comment */</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="object-extension-pointer">Object-Extension Pointer</h3>
<p>When extending an object within a separate partial, leave a comment pointing to the original base object in order to establish a concrete link between the object and its extension <a href="README.md#works-cited">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Example: <code>scss /**  * Foo-Bar  *  * Extends the .foo object within _foo-object.scss  */  .foo--bar {...}</code></p>
<h2 id="formating">Formating</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use one selector per line in multi-selector rulesets and separate each ruleset with a blank line.</li>
<li>Use one space before the opening brace of a ruleset and place the closing brace of a ruleset in the same column as the first character of the ruleset and use one space after the colon of a declaration.</li>
<li>Include one declaration per line and one level of indentation for each declaration.</li>
<li>Use upper-case, hex color codes, i.e. <code>#FFFFFF</code>.</li>
<li>Use double quotes for quoted attribute values in selectors; ex: <code>input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]</code></li>
<li><em>Where allowed</em>, avoid specifying units for zero-values ex: <code>margin: 0;</code>.</li>
<li>Follow every comma with a space for comma-separated property values and include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration in a declaration block.</li>
<li>Declarations should be grouped by their function - positioning rules, box-model rules, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>Large blocks of single declarations can use a slightly different single-line format. In this case space should be included after the opening brace and before the closing brace.</p>
<p>Example: <code>css .selector-1 { width: 10%; } .selector-2 { width: 20%; } .selector-3 { width: 30%; }</code> Long comma-separated property values, such as collections of gradients or shadows, can be arranged across multiple lines in an effort to improve readability and produce more useful diffs <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Example: <code>css .selector {   background-image:     linear-gradient(#FFFCCC),     linear-gradient(#F3C4EC);   box-shadow:     1px 1px 1px #000,     2px 2px 1px 1px #CCCCCC inset; }</code></p>
<h3 id="units">Units</h3>
<ul>
<li>When building a responsive design system always try to use relative units to allow system components and font-size to scale to the user's viewport. Use pixels only when you have a really good reason NOT to use <code>em</code>'s or <code>rem</code>s.</li>
<li>When using <code>rem</code>'s (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=rem">see browser support</a>), provide a fall-back for IE8 and Opera Mini and abstract this into a Sass mixin for ease of use.</li>
<li>Use unit-less <code>line-height</code>. It does not inherit a percentage value of its parent element - it's based on a multiplier of the <code>font-size</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid absolute measurements. For example, by using <code>.dropdown-nav li:hover   { top: 37px; }</code> you are coding a single point of failure into your interface. Instead, build with flexibility in mind by using <code>.dropdown-nav   li:hover { top: 100%; }</code> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[13]</a>.</li>
<li>Consider using <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/more-meaningful-typography/">Modular Scales</a> to help define your proportional rhythms within your designs. The <a href="https://github.com/scottkellum/modular-scale">Sassy Modular Scale</a> Ruby Gem makes working with Modular Scales easy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By using culturally relevant historically pleasing ratios to create modular scales and basing the measurements in our compositions on values from those scaleswe can achieve a visual harmony not found in layouts that use arbitraryconventionalor easily divisible numbers.&quot; - <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/more-meaningful-typography/">Tim Brown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<h2 id="working-with-partials">Working with Partials</h2>
<p>Partials in Sass begin with an underscore and are not compiled into final output unless they are explicitly included within a Sass file. Using Sass <code>@import</code> includes all partials after compiling and does not incur an additional http request as they do in regular CSS. For this reason, partials should be used for all base, component, and layout styles. These partials should then be included into a single core Sass file which provides the opportunity to easily turn styles on and off as needed. When including partials within your base stylesheet, leave off the file extension to allow for easier conversion between Sass and SCSS syntaxes if you ever need to do so <a href="README.md#works-cited">[17]</a>. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/blob/master/sass/screen.scss">Example screen.scss</a></p>
<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h2>
<p>By categorizing CSS rules we begin to see patterns and can define best practices around each of these patterns <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="base">Base</h3>
<p>The base directory contains styles and settings that apply to the entire project. These include the <code>_color-pallet.scss</code> and <code>_typography-pallet.scss</code> partials as well as settings for compass and compass plugins. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/tree/master/sass/base">Example Base Styles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="component">Component</h3>
<p>Components are the equivalent to Modules within the <a href="smacss.com">SMACSS</a> methodology renamed here to avoid confusion with Drupal's terminology. Components are modular and reusable entities of a design system. Example components include buttons, call to actions, navigation elements, etc. Each component is defined within its own partial inside the component directory. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/tree/master/sass/components">Example Component Styles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>Layout styles provide structure to (mobile-first) linear content. These styles are used to progressively enhance the basic layout when device capability, viewport and/or connection speed allow. Because layout is treated as an enhancement, these styles are kept separate from the components they enhance and are applied with their own class. Each component's layout is defined in its own partial inside the layout directory. Layout stylesheets are named by prefixing the component's name with <code>l-</code> in order to explicitly define the relationship between layout and component. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/tree/master/sass/layout">Example Layout Styles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="object">Object</h3>
<p>Object styles are generic abstractions that can be extended to build a component. The classic OOCSS example is the media-object <a href="README.md#works-cited">[16]</a>. Each object is defined within its own partial inside the object directory. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/tree/master/sass/objects">Example Object Styles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="utilities">Utilities</h3>
<p>Utilities are code snippets abstracted into classes, functions, and mixins that provide specific functionality. Utilities include normalize, clearfix, css-triangles, etc. Utilities can be given their own directory within the project's root, or they can be abstracted into a Compass plugin or Bower component. Example: <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Utilities">Archetype-Utilities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temp">Temp</h3>
<p>The temporary directory contains any styles that haven't yet been properly defined and organized within the project's architecture. This where any hacks or quick fixes belong. Each 'fix' placed within this directory should be given its own partial and should be accompanied by a corresponding issue properly tagged and filed in the project's repository so that it can be properly incorporated into the code base at a later date. Preventing sub-standard code from being committed into the code base helps to prevent un-necessary depreciation as well as unintentionally introducing bugs by keeping these 'fixes' quarantined within the temp directory. <a href="README.md#works-cited">[25]</a></p>
<h2 id="object-oriented-css-oocss">Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[A] CSS “object” is a repeating visual pattern which can be abstracted into an independent snippet of HTML CSS and possibly JavaScript. Once created an object can then be reused throughout a site.&quot; - <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">Nichole Sullivan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="two-main-principles-of-oocss">Two Main Principles of OOCSS</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Separation of Structure from Skin - distinguish between structure styles (box-model) and skin styles (color, font, gradients) and abstract these styles in class-based modules to allow re-use <a href="README.md#works-cited">[6]</a>.</li>
<li>Separation of Container and Content - avoid all explicit parent-child relationship within style declarations so that a component's style is not dependant upon its container which allows the module to be reused <a href="README.md#works-cited">[6]</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="object-oriented-classes">Object Oriented Classes</h4>
<p>Building complex components with smaller, more discrete code blocks leads to more reusable code, easier debugging, and a DRYer code base by cutting down on repetition. A component is comprised of object, structure, and skin. Class naming and <a href="#selector-construct">selector construct</a> is very important. This syntax and naming convention illustrates the intention of a class and its relationship to others.</p>
<p>Components use a multi-class pattern in order to allow for easier contextual based adjustments when necessary, and to help simplify class and variable names <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>. For example, structure, skin, and state styles are extended via their own class, rather than attaching a suffix to an existing component class.</p>
<p>In this way a component can be thought of as a specific combination of classes. Changing even one of these classes constitutes an entierly different component. For example, the same button component with two different skin classes is two different components. Additionally, an object could be represented as a single class or even a Sass <code>@extend</code> such as a clearfix. A component does not have to be a visual entity.</p>
<h3 id="object-styles">Object Styles</h3>
<p>Styles which remain consistent and unchanged within a component regardless of skin or structure. These styles are abstracted and may be used as a foundation for building additional components. This is the base class that can be modified or extended with a structure and skin. <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype/tree/master/sass/objects">Example Objects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="structure-styles">Structure Styles</h3>
<p>Styles which control a component's physical structure. Structure styles include any properties involving spacing which could potentially effect surrounding elements on the page, i.e. box-model properties. Structure classes extend an object class. There must be no dependencies between structure and skin.</p>
<h3 id="skin-styles">Skin Styles</h3>
<p>Styles which control a component's visual appearance. Skin styles include any properties involving color, typography, gradients, shadows, etc. Skin classes extend an object class. There must be no dependencies between skin and structure.</p>
<p><em>Note: Sometimes the distinction between structure and skin is non-trivial. For example, the arrival of border-box has greatly simplified the box-model, but makes the border property a bit more difficult to define in this context because it no longer contributes to an element's width (structure). The best way to handle this is to split up border property defining border-width and border-style as structure and border-color as skin. An example that makes this more clear is when building a tab component where the structure of the tab requires a transparent bottom border for the active tab and the skin of the tab requires a light gray border.</em></p>
<h3 id="layout-styles">Layout Styles</h3>
<p>Styles that define how a component sits on the page. A component's layout class uses the <code>.l-</code> prefix followed by the component's name. Layout styles include width and grid layout.</p>
<h2 id="naming-conventions-and-structure">Naming Conventions and Structure</h2>
<p>An effective naming convention explicitly communicates the context and function of the entity being named.</p>
<h3 id="component-1">Component</h3>
<p>A discrete, independent entity designed to exist as a stand alone module without any depenedencies to its container. A component can be simple or compound (contain one or more components) and it should be able to be relocated on the page without breaking <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>. Example components include buttons, navigation bars, carousels, etc. An example of a compound component would be a search block composed of an input and a submit button <a href="README.md#works-cited">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>In order to maintain modularity a component must adhere to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Component styles must not declare any explicit size constraints, allowing the module to scale to it's parent container. A component can be placed inside a layout component, i.e. a grid; or extended with a layout class, but it must never be given an explicit width.</li>
<li>A component must remain independent from siblings, children, and parents allowing for arbitrarily placement within a design system. This means that CSS ID Selectors must be avoided to allow components to remain non-unique (able to appear on the same page more than once).</li>
<li>A component's name must be unique to the project to ensure that only instances of the same component can have the same name. Re-using a component also means re-using its behavior. To use the same component with differing behavior requires a new component.</li>
<li>Selectors must remain context free and un-coupled to HTML by avoiding the use of elements within CSS selectors. HTML element styles are scoped by placing a class on either the element itself or on a parent container. This means all HTML element styles are opt-in (opposed to opt-out) making the only &quot;default&quot; HTML element styles are those applied by normalize, thus avoiding redundant overrides. <a href="README.md#works-cited">[27]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[28]</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="element">Element</h4>
<p>An element is a context-dependant descendent of an object that performs a certain function and is represented by an additional class for a component or a descendent css selector. Elements are denoted by the use of <code>__</code> (double underscores) i.e. <code>.component-name__element-name</code> in order to maintain the elements context, maintain control of the cascade, and avoid location-dependant selectors <a href="README.md#works-cited">[2]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements are context-dependant - they are only used within the context of their parent object.</li>
<li>Element name must be unique within the scope of its object and must have a unique name to be used within a css rule</li>
<li>Elements can be repeated within a component, i.e. tabs or navigation elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: ```scss .object__element {...} /* element class */</p>
<p>.object { &amp; &gt; li {...} /* descendent selector */ }</p>
<p>```</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;ul</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;object&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;li</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;object__element&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>home<span class="kw">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="sub-object">Sub-Object</h4>
<p>A sub-object is a context-dependant sibling of an object that performs a certain function and is represented by an additional class for a component. Sub-objects are similar to elements in syntax and in relation to an object, but they differ significantly in the way that a sub-object extends or provides minor overrides to the object and is applied to the <em>same</em> HTML element. Sub-objects are denoted by the use of <code>__</code> (double underscores) i.e. <code>.component-name__sub-component-name</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A variant of a component that inherits all the styles of its object, but differs by adding additional object styles, or providing minor overrides of its object. When object overrides become significant, the creation of an additional object should be considered.</li>
<li>A component's sub-component are siblings of the component and are prefixed with the full name of the parent component followed by <code>__</code> (double underscores). This clearly indicates a sub-object's relationship to its object and also prevents the sub-object's styles from applying outside of the object's scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: ```scss .nav__pager {...} /* Sub-Component */</p>
<p>```</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;ul</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;nav nav__pager&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  ...
<span class="kw">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="object-extension">Object Extension</h3>
<p>A significant variant of a component applied as an additional class on the component. Object extensions extend an object by applying additional styles related to either structure or skin. Extension classes are prefixed with the object's name followed by <code>--</code> (double dashes) and the extension name i.e. <code>.object--skin</code> or <code>.object--structure</code>.</p>
<p>Example: ```scss .btn--primary {...} .btn--large {..}</p>
<p>```</p>
<h4 id="state">State</h4>
<p>A state is a variant of a component that is triggered by an action or behavior. State styles are applied dynamically as an additional class on the component's root or child HTML element.</p>
<ul>
<li>State based styles are indicated with the <code>is-</code> prefix, i.e. <code>.is-active</code>, <code>.is-disabled</code>. These style declarations are shared by CSS and JS files <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>A component's state styles should be grouped with the component in the same partial.</li>
<li>Multiple states may be used at once.</li>
</ul>
Example: ```html
<button type="submit" class="btn btn--large btn--primary is-disabled">
Submit
</button>

<p>```</p>
Example: ```html
<ul class="nav nav__vertical nav--large nav--primary">
  <li class="nav__element is-active">
...
</li>
</ul>

<p>```</p>
<h3 id="layout-1">Layout</h3>
<ul>
<li>All components are fluid by nature and should never be given explicit width or height restraints. A component's width is determined by its parent container or grid system.</li>
<li>Heights should only be explicitly defined for elements which had dimensions before they entered the system; e.g. image, video. In all other cases use line-height instead which is far more flexible <a href="README.md#works-cited">[13]</a>.</li>
<li>The grid system should never have styles or box-model properties directly applied - grid items contain content, but are not content in themselves.</li>
<li>Layout based styles are indicated with the <code>l-</code> prefix in order to distinguish them from module or state styles <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="icons">Icons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Icons should be styled as independent entities to allow their use in <em>any</em> component without the need for duplication of code.</li>
<li>Icon components are prefixed with <code>ico-</code>.</li>
<li>Icon styles should be split into structure and skin (<code>.ico-small</code> &amp; <code>.ico-profile classes</code>) in order to allow for maximum flexibility and minimal code repetition <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Use Compass to manage sprits easily.</li>
<li>Sprited Icons should be added to empty elements that have their text hidden off canvas.</li>
<li>Use Compass to manage image directories easily</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classes added dynamically via JavaScript are prefixed with <code>.js-</code> to indicate their dependency.</li>
<li>A '.js-' prefixed class should never be referenced in a stylesheet. They used exclusively from JavaScript files <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selector-construct">Selector Construct</h2>
<p>Selector construct must explicitly communicate the context and function of the entity being named. Also, selector construct must be consistently applied to allow for efficient use of grep and more meaningful diffs. The BEM Methodology <a href="README.md#works-cited">[2]</a> and interpretations of BEM <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[13]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[26]</a> make use of an efficient system to accomplish these goals by explicitly communicating the function and context of the entity being named, as well as its relationship to both child and parent components while avoiding deeply nested selectors that tie content to container and make assumptions about markup. In this way, a BEM-like system helps to reinforce our primary objective of modularity.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there is an element of added complexity, but the sacrifice of simple selectors in order to preserve objected oriented principles is well worth it especially considering the fact that GZIP handles repetition extremely well.</p>
<h3 id="naming-pattern">Naming Pattern</h3>
<p>This naming pattern is inspired by the BEM Methodology <a href="README.md#works-cited">[2]</a> as well as several interpretations by other developers <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>, <a href="README.md#works-cited">[26]</a>.</p>
<pre class="scss"><code>// component name
.object {}                        /* represents the higher-level abstraction of a component */

.object__modifier {}              /* represents a modification of an object */

&amp;.is-disabled {}                  /* object state */
.l-btn--call-to-action            /* layout styles for call-to-action */
</code></pre>
<h3 id="css-class-semantics">CSS Class Semantics</h3>
<p>Class names should remain content-independent<a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>. By avoiding tightly coupled class names and content semantics, code is more easily reused and modularized to allow for increased scalability of your architecture. Because the most reusable code components are those with content-independent class names, class names should be derived from repeating structural or functional patterns and never from the content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We shouldn't be afraid of making the connections between layers clear and explicit rather than having class names rigidly reflect specific content. Doing this doesn't make classes &quot;unsemantic&quot;, it just means that their semantics are not derived from the content.&quot; - <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">Nicolas Gallager</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Increasing semantic value of a section of html and content <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>
<ul>
<li>Content-layer semantics are served by html elements and attributes <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a></li>
<li>Class names communicate useful information to developers and serve hooks for CSS or JavaScript <a href="README.md#works-cited">[3]</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decrease the expectation of a specific HTML structure <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important distinction is that the HTML class attributes are semantic in the way they convey meaning to the developer, rather than the content. Content receives it's semantic value from its markup (HTML tags and ARIA attributes). Code receives its semantic value from its classes.</p>
<h3 id="specificity">Specificity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The problem with such a depth is that it enforces a much greater dependency on a particular HTML structure. Components on the page can’t be easily moved around&quot; - <a href="http://smacss.com/book/applicability">Jonathan Snook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minimize &quot;depth of applicability&quot; in order to avoid over-reliance on a predefined HTML structure and hindering modularity and flexibility of components. This also helps to prevent introducing potential specificity issues which are notoriously difficult to debug. When selectors are kept succinct, it also becomes easier to convert components into templates for dynamic content <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>.</p>
<h4 id="guidelines-for-minimal-specificity">Guidelines for Minimal Specificity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Do not use CSS ID selectors.</li>
<li>Do not use location based selectors to change a component's appearance based on its page position or region - i.e. (main-content, side-bar, footer, etc) <a href="README.md#works-cited">[17]</a>. When a component has different appearances create a new component by changing out its structure or skin class.</li>
<li>Always name-space state class names e.g. <code>.is-disabled</code>, <code>.is-collapsed</code> - never explicitly style a state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <code>scss .btn--skin {   // skin styles here...   &amp;.is-disabled {     // disabled styles here...      } }</code> * Avoid the use of element selectors in order to keep them free from context and un-coupled to the HTML. Scope HTML element selectors with a class on the root element or a parent element so that these styles are opt-in rather than opt-out. This will avoid redundant overrides of un-needed styles and keep specificity minimal. <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[27]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">[28]</a> * !important should be avoided as much as possible. State classes are an example of an acceptable use of important <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a>. * Never qualify a selector with an element selector e.g. <code>ul.nav</code>, as this decreases selector performance, creates a context dependency, and increases the selector's specificity. These are all things to be avoided <a href="README.md#works-cited">[1]</a> <a href="README.md#works-cited">12</a>.</p>
