# JavaScript Guidelines

* Write JavaScript, not CoffeeScript. 
* Use semicolons.
* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.
* Name-space top level objects.
* Use the same CSS component names within JavaScript to implement its functionality.
* Use HTML5 data-attributes, or a CSS class with the `.js-` prefix so that components with similar behavior can be detected to apply the required dynamic behavior and to avoid confusion between presentational and functional hooks.
* Animate an interface using CSS classes never inline styles.
* Use CSS3 transitions. When transitions are not supported the state will still be updated [[1]](index.html#works-cited).
