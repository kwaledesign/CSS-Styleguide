Coding Standards
================

# Git Guidelines

* Commit early and often keeping commits granular and logical.
* Limit commit messages to 50 characters. Include more detailed explanations involving intention and/or implementation in GitHub issue tracker.
* Omit trailing punctuation.
* Break up commits into logical, modular sections and commit whitespace changes separately to allow for more meaningful diffs.
* Provide a succinct description of exactly what was changed using the imperative present tens, i.e. "fix", "remove", "add".

Example:

{% highlight bash %}
  git commit -m "fix issue 99"
{% endhighlight %}
